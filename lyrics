Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A smooth criminal
